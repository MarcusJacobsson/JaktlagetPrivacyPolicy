  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 8, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Jaktlaget</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>a. Account Information</h3>
  <p>
    The App requires users to sign in using <strong>Google’s Firebase Authentication</strong> service.
    When you create or log into your account, your authentication details (such as your email address or Google account ID) are handled securely by Google’s servers — not by this App directly.
    We do not store or manage any account credentials within the App itself.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Hunting Team Information</h3>
  <p>
    The App allows you to optionally save information about hunting team members, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Names</li>
    <li>Email addresses</li>
    <li>Telephone numbers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is entered voluntarily and stored securely in a <strong>Firebase database</strong>,
    which is hosted and managed by <strong>Google</strong>.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>
    The information you provide is used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable account access and authentication</li>
    <li>Display and manage your hunting team information within the App</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use this data for advertising.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All user-related data (account and team information) is stored using <strong>Google Firebase services</strong>, which implement strong industry-standard security measures.
    No user data is stored locally on your device beyond temporary cache or standard app data.
    We rely on Google’s secure infrastructure to protect your information against unauthorized access or disclosure.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.
    However, your data may be accessible to Google as part of their Firebase and Authentication service operations, under Google’s own privacy policies.
  </p>
  <p>

    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete your account or data at any time by using the relevant options within the App or by contacting us directly.
    Deleting your account will remove associated data from our Firebase database.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under 13.
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data,
    please contact us, and we will take steps to remove it.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    All updates will be posted in this document with a revised “Effective Date” at the top.
